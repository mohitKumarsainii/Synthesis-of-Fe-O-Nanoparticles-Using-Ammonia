## **Procedure**

### Step 1: Preparation of Iron Salt Solution

1. **Weighing the Reagents**:
   - Take **973.2 mg of FeCl₂** and **648.0 mg of FeCl₃**.
   - Dissolve both salts in **20 mL of distilled water**.

2. **Mixing and Heating**:
   - Stir the solution for **15 minutes** at **50°C** using a magnetic stirrer.
   - This ensures the complete dissolution of the salts and formation of Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ ions in a **2:1 molar ratio**.

### Step 2: Precipitation of Fe₃O₄ Nanoparticles

1. **Adding Ammonia (NH₃)**:
   - Gradually add ammonia solution (NH₃) while stirring the solution.
   - Adjust the pH to **11**. This will cause the formation of Fe(OH)₂ and Fe(OH)₃ as intermediate compounds.

2. **Formation of Fe₃O₄**:
   - Upon further stirring, Fe(OH)₂ and Fe(OH)₃ react to form **Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles**.
   - The color of the solution will change from yellowish to brownish, indicating the formation of magnetite (Fe₃O₄).

### Step 3: Stirring and Aging

1. **Magnetic Stirring**:
   - Continue stirring the mixture at **50°C** for **1 hour** to promote uniform growth of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles.
   
### Step 4: Washing the Nanoparticles

1. **Separation**:
   - After 1 hour of stirring, separate the precipitate (Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles) from the solution using a **magnetic separator**.

2. **Washing with Distilled Water**:
   - Wash the Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles **3–4 times** with distilled water to remove any soluble impurities, including excess NH₃ and iron salts.

3. **Washing with Ethanol**:
   - Wash the nanoparticles with ethanol to remove any organic impurities and ensure purity.

### Step 5: Drying and Grinding

1. **Drying the Nanoparticles**:
   - Transfer the washed nanoparticles to an oven and dry them at **100°C** for **7 hours** to remove all moisture.

2. **Grinding the Nanoparticles**:
   - After drying, use a **mortar and pestle** to grind the nanoparticles for **30 minutes** to reduce their size and increase surface area. The final particle size should be small and uniform.

## **Precautions**

1. **Handle Ammonia (NH₃) Safely**: Work in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood. Wear gloves, goggles, and a mask to avoid inhalation and contact.
2. **Add NH₃ Gradually**: Introduce NH₃ slowly under stirring to control pH and prevent uneven precipitation.
3. **Temperature Control**: Maintain a steady 50°C during the reaction to ensure proper nanoparticle formation.
4. **Proper Waste Disposal**: Dispose of waste solutions responsibly, following local hazardous waste regulations.
